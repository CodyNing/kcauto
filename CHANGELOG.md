#### 0.2.0

* Implements the Combat Engine option
  * 'legacy' uses per-combat-node specification of formations and night battles
  * 'live' uses live tracking of the fleet icon to automatically determine formations and night battles
* Implements the Formations and NightBattles options
  * Formations are comma-separated and must be specified in the form of <Node>:<Formation>
  * NightBattles are comma-separated and must be specified in the form of <Node>:<True|False>
  * The <Node>s for the two options must be specified as the nth-combat node number in 'legacy' mode. In 'live' mode, the <Node>s can be specified as either the nth-combat node number or the alpha-numeric node name. The nth-combat node number takes priority over the alpha-numeric node name
* Updates the webUI to support the above additions to the config

* Improves `recovery()` so that it attempts to recovery in more locations
