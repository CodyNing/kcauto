## Contributing to kcauto-kai

* Before opening a PR, open an issue ticket in the [kcauto-kai issue tracker](https://github.com/mrmin123/kcauto-kai/issues) referencing the work you are doing. Please reference the ticket by its # in the PR.

* All PRs should be made to the `staging` branch. Only code tested and verified in `staging` will be merged into `master` for release.

* All PRs should be up to date with `staging` at time of submission. It is up to the PR submitter to keep their branch up to date.

* Please abide by the Python and JavaScript style and linting rules. kcauto-kai uses the [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and an extended version of the [AirBnB JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for Python and JavasScript, respectively. Please use your favorite linter to ensure consistency.

* The JavaScript bundle for the frontend web UI is generated pre-push to master directly on staging. Please do not submit a PR with an updated `bundle.js`. If you've generated an updated `bundle.js`, check the file out back from the `staging` branch to reset it.
