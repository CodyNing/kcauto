              <strong>kcauto-kai</strong> is a robust Kantai Collection automation tool. The successor

              proof-of-concepts in using Sikuli for vision-based scripting to automate the playing of Kantai Collection
              and are exercises in automating large, convoluted, and complex game logic. It is not designed to be the
              fastest automation tool, but instead designed to be robust and highly
              customizable. <strong>Please read the Disclaimer section before use!</strong>
